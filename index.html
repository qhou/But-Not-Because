          <p class="paragraph">
            <div class="paragraph">We have all seen homeless people and think that we have some level of understanding of them.
            But we tend to think of ourselves as ‚ÄúWE,‚Äù and homeless people as ‚ÄúTHEM.‚Äù
            Regardless of the level of exposure, understanding, and empathy - or lack of them-  one tends to dissociate, neglect, and excuse oneself from those who are in less fortunate circumstances.<br><br></div>
            <div class="paragraph">,But Not Because is a project centred around ‚ÄúTHEM‚Äù<br>
              I am homeless, but not because ___ . We believe that the individuals become homeless, not necessarily for the reasons or factors that society has put on them, for the better or worse.
              The purpose and the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of this project it to explore their side of the narrative through their voice.
              For once, we are asking participants to try to see their world and journey through their shoes.<br><br><div>

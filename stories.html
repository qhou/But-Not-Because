                            <p class="modal-paragraph">I live in a hotel. I used to have an apartment, but over the years, [i [rented] with two brothers, and you could afford, and it was not too bad.
                              Then one guy, he committed suicide. He got into some kind of smoking stuff.
                              <br><br>
                              And his brother well, we never got along. We always argued, because he,
                              I don't know, he was just-- he was that way no matter what it wasn't good, not matter what.
                              Come home, he'd complain a little like this and that.
                              <br><br>
                              I used to get mad at him; we used to have [fights]. He'd slam the door and go somewhere else. That's not going to work, is it.
                              I said, either you've gotta run, or we've gotta get out of here. I said, I cannot take it all by myself.
                              <br><br>
                              So I knew the other hotel was booking place at that time eh. Then when I got in there, I had to move up and down that stairway and I couldn't, so I had to move into another hotel.
                              <br><br>
                              All along there, there's drugs, drugs, drugs guys next to me, selling stolen drugs, selling stuff, doing stupid things. There were guys coming all hours of the night, knocking on their door doing those things that are not legal, I knew that.
                              So how do you deal with it, you're trying to live, rest, and there's always something going on, you don't feel safe anymore. People that deal with drugs, people that deal with souls, are not to be trusted.
                              <br><br>
                              For now, I'm in the corner by myself away from them, but they're still there eh, that presence is always there. When you come home, it's always that look, you can tell these people in their eyes eh. It's out of habit, they get so into this thing-- they want to sell their soul for this, to get their next fix. It's just like the worst of them. I never get involved with that stuff.
                              This area is a volunteer police station, CPC centre. They have apartments upstairs. In a way, ["I feel safer here]. You got the law under you blanket.
                              It is a little bit better here than there, some law enforcement on your side. People can't go too far. You gotta hold some kind of thing over their head so that they won't go too far. [ ] You don't really know [how] people are unless you hang around for a while. Just how bad people can be sometimes. What's wrong with you? Like they're normal people, but gotta always do something negative. 
                              <br><br>
                              <i>"How's your day been?"</i>
                              <br><br>
                              [My day has been] not too bad; there's positive and negatives.
                              I got out of the hospital a little while ago; I got knifed on Granville Street about a month ago at night time I was laid down for a while, it wasn't anything really really bad. It could've been bad, if nothing was there or done about it.
                              <br><br>
                              It wasn't that deep. Then I got the pleurisy [...], an infection you get in the lungs, ribs. I put in twice tubes in, and it's very painful and you put holes in. I don't want anybody to have that; it's not the best thing. I had to clean this thing off, then the wound, twice in the hospital for that.
                              <br><br>
                              Then I cracked my shoulder blade. I just got off the bus, somehow bump on something, A dog or something around the corner; there wasn't an attack or anything.  Suddenly, I got startled. I had something in my hand and I moved rapidly, I automatically walked and put my bag something between me and the dog, and I felt something go "arrrrghh". You know you got that nervous thing? Like something happened. Then you go to move your arm. and "ahhhhiii". That's what happened.But it actually didn't show up on a CT scan.
                              [Cause then you got sterilized check] You got one rib that's cracked, and then I went oh I need another one of those scans. Then they had to do another time with those tubes. First of all VGH  and then I ended up in Lion's Gate. []
                              The doctor there found something the other doctor couldn't find...

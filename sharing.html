                            <span class="modal-paragraph">"With so much to say, I strangely find myself at lost of words.
                              <br><br>
                              This initiative started with as a raging discussion with Tina in the summer 2016,
                              and has grown in ways that I could have not previously imagined, and preserved through rejection and scepticism.
                              <br><br>
                              We thought to ourselves and wanted to somewhat prove to society through  conversations on the streets,
                              that people experience homelessness or poverty, not always because of the reasons or factors that society has forced onto them.
                              During these series of conversations, I grew to connect with the storytellers,
                              and instead of wanting to disprove what society wants to think about them,
                              I wanted more to connect the gap of communication and understanding.
                              <br><br>
                              There is a community that is too often overlooked, neglected, and disassociated from the rest of society.
                              And though this has become the norm for many, through the exhibition,
                              I look forward to seeing people pause and think about their actions and what they can do to create a healthier community.
                              <br><br>
                              It can be as simple as a nod of acknowledge, a smile, or a response.
                              <br><br>
                              We’re all human, and we all belong to the same society.
                              <br><br>
                              For a lack of articulation of the complexity of my thoughts and emotions,
                              I genuinely hope this initiative seeds a thought all the people it comes in contact with, creating a ripple effect somewhere down the road.
                              <br><br>
                              Thank you to all those who have shared, listened, helped, or offered to do so. This project would not have been possible without you. "</span>

                            <span class="modal-paragraph">"I was intrigued by the ideas of ButNotBecause when [it was] first introduced it to me.
                              I have a friend who once lived in a shelter and a temporary tent; however,
                              despite having a friend who belonged to the homeless community,
                              I barely had any knowledge about it.
                              I truly appreciate the opportunity to participate in ButNotBecause to learn more about my community by going on the streets and interviewing the homeless people.
                              By visiting different parts of Vancouver, a city known for its flourishing economy and a city which I thought I had known for years,
                              I discovered the hidden side of the city - one that is fragile yet often ignored by the majority of the citizens -
                              the homeless community. By learning the stories of these people’s lives,
                              I was able to walk in their shoes and see the world through their point of view.
                              The unspoken truth of the general public unintentionally or intentionally ignoring the existence of the homeless community was both shocking and depressing for me.
                              Through this project, I hope to continue the initiative by connecting two communities that are fundamentally the same,
                              the homeless and the general public, and ultimately change the general knowledge and attitude toward this part of our society."</span>

                              <span class="modal-paragraph">"You'd be surprised at how many people claim to know why the caged bird sings without ever having to comprehend or work through the aftermath of a poisonous "bubble"s effects and its overlapping complexities. I was exposed to some pretty extreme communities growing up, and when I came to Vancouver as a student, the strong intention of authentically engaging with the right community steered so many of my decisions. As someone who's     circumstances caused her to spend most of her life in confinement, the way I saw perspective was not through traveling or physically escaping "the bubble".
                              <br><br>
                              It was through reading, writing, and analyzing the nuances and details that affect the neuro-diverse people living in all kinds of communities. Nothing is black and white through my lenses, and there's no way I could describe myself in a cute social media blurb that limits my speech to 100 characters. The stigmas, the fetishes, the diverging channels of thoughts, the shared yet individualized concerns and tragedies. And so from a young age, I fell in love with perspective, feeling as if I'd been left with this paralyzing inability to take anything at face value and an impulse to sensitize desensitization. Maybe I couldn't see the world through HD photos, but I could hear the vulnerabilities and the critiques. My past, my raging mental illness, and my addiction to perspective filled up all of my free time with 5 community oriented jobs in the past year alone, paid and unpaid. It's a crucial component of my daily medication.
                              <br><br>
                              I threw myself into everything yielding actual results- whether it's trudging through the snow in New Westminster for 4 hour disability legislation-changing canvassing shifts and mapping out how people view non-profits, teaching in the Downtown Eastside and North Vancouver neighborhood houses and special needs shelters, or creating personalized libraries for people who need company while slogging their way out of rehab. For victims who find tear-inducing beauty in the simple dreams of getting a blue collar job with a steady paycheck, rather than clawing their way to the top as young as possible to look down with vengeance on all of those who ever doubted their power or showed them bad blood.
                              <br><br>
                              I don't see getting involved as marketing yourself through self-commodification and connecting for the sake of drenching resumes in pretty words and crafting flamboyant essays about how therapeutic and eye-opening your community involvement was. It's not about abusing your birthright platform placed at your feet. The people who receive community aid have been manipulated and abandoned for the entirely of their lives, whether its systematic or personal. How would they feel if they knew that even the kindness and attention they were given, was not entirely selfless? And through what I've gathered through my humanitarian work, I know that most of them already normalize that. I choose to direct most of my work to the real, outside community, because those are where the results effect life and death- where you need to care every single day, not just during retreats or charisma-overdosed election periods.
                              <br><br>
                              And that's why I joined But Not Because. The art of storytelling to further expand perspective in a society that worships a little term I coined, "slacktivism", makes my heart melt. As young adults, we may not have the power to change entire lives, but we can definitely aid in changing mindsets, which starts it's own domino effect. That is my hope for this initiative. Get outside and see the world! Not you, your mind. "</span>

                            <hr>
                              <span class="modal-paragraph">
                                Is it bad chance or bad decision?
                                <br><br>
                                I asked myself when Quin told me about the idea of ‘But Not Because’.
                                What are the stories behind the homeless we pass by on the street or the signs that say “Any help including food will do”.
                                I wonder. It wasn’t out of nobility nor kind heart.
                                <br><br>
                                I would say more because of curiosity.
                                Historical stories have long been telling people about the power of the knowledge or the lack of it,
                                as well as the time and the situation that shape people’s life in the bigger perspective.
                                One can say for some, the destiny is set upon birth. However,
                                here are also many good examples of efforts overcoming poverty and other forms of difficulties.
                                Having these two sides in mind, I started the interview.
                                <br><br>
                                Walking on the streets of Vancouver downtown with Carly,
                                it took us more than 20 min to not find a suitable person to have a chat with.
                                When we finally met the first new friend on the street, he was reading a Startrek novel.
                                When asked if we can have a little chat to learn about his life, he wasn’t too happy and expressed his time isn’t free.
                                However, as we sat down casually, he started rambling about his life without gasp.
                                The story was rather, for lack of better word, typical. Addiction concludes the story.
                                Drug and alcohol are the main characters with the help of evil corporate sidekick and the story ends with “I am just so tired of failing, so I rather stop trying”.
                                <br><br>
                                The encounter didn’t end well.
                                He asked for some cash, but we were advised to provide material help instead of direct cash aid.
                                When the food pack was offered, our new friend took just the juice and shoved us away saying “waste of his time”.
                                <br><br>
                                Many might think there I have it, at least for this man, bad decision and lack of will are the reason.
                                He once had a good job, but he burned it down all because of lack of self-control,
                                but I can’t help to think what would I do if I grew up the exact same way as he did?
                                <br><br>
                                Perhaps it was the lack of direction and goal in life that just made falling back to the defaults so much more appealing and easier.
                                <br>
                                Perhaps it was the people he grew up with, the family that doesn’t talk to him anymore.
                                I certainly can’t conclude, or maybe that is the answer, just combination of different elements.
                                One can’t just blame or pinpoint one or even more causes, rather a combination and reaction of many elements.
                                <br><br>
                                Just when I think I come down to this boring and plain conclusion,
                                I realized what stroke me the most are not the reasons of why one becomes homeless,
                                but rather when I put myself to my new friend’s shoe, I empathize and really humanize him.
                                Not that he was dehumanized before, but I felt the connection and certain helplessness inside.
                                <br><br>It was a weird feeling.
                                If I have to describe it, it is like I am drowning in the dream and I know I am in the dream;
                                all I have to do to escape is to wake up, but I somehow can’t seem to wake up from it.
                                To put myself in my new friend’s shoe is like that. It is easy to think all I have to do is to not fall back to the drug and alcohol (or to wake up),
                                but when you are in the situation, you can’t wake up (stay clean).
                                <br><br>
                                Is there a moral lesson to my story? Maybe you see something, but for me,
                                it is just a bizarre feeling like how the world is. Right or wrong is just a perspective, but the suffer is real.
